            <h1 class="text-start mb-4 mt-5 fw-bold">Before you HIRE any Graphic Designer, I want you to look at these 4 things carefully‚ö†Ô∏è</h1>
            <span class="text-start mb-3">If you plan on running successful marketing campaigns or generating leads with your ads, then you'll agree with me you can't do without CREATIVES (graphic designers, writers e.t.c)
            </span>
            <div class="col-12">
                <p class="text-start mb-3">Not everyone who identifies as creatives are actually creative. Some people say this but it doesn't hold any meaning in their heart. </p>
                    
                <p class="mb-3">
                    You see, creatives are individuals who are constantly seeking ways to solve problems. They can do this in an innovative manner and they generally see things differently than others do. <br>
                    There are so many Graphic Designers but how do you know who is right for youüò¢. I feel your pain and I'm here to help you figure it out. <br>
                    Anyone can learn how to use the tools of Graphic Design but NOT Everyone can translate that skill into solving problems. I've even heard some business owners say they've attempted designing some of their company graphics themselves but they don't like the result. And that is why they outsource a professional designer to handle it for them. In fact, this same scenario once played out for me. A client came to me to narrate how he needed a design to run his ads and he wanted me to handle it because it needed to appeal to his targets.<br>
                    Actually, this particular client has an idea of how to use some design tools but he realized this was way above him and he needed a creative solution to solve this problem.
                    Look at these 4 things carefully before proceeding to hire a Graphic designer ;

                    <h5 class="fw-bold mb-3">1Ô∏è‚É£Know what you want and find out his/her design process</h5>
                    <p>Did you notice how I didn't even mention portfolio first? This is the mistake many clients make. They just run and check portfolio üòÖ without even having an idea of what they want first. When you have an idea of what you want and know his design process, it's easier to communicate with him and get the results you want.
                        </p>

                        <p>It gives you an idea of how they can also help you achieve the same results they did with other clients.
                            </p>

                            <h5 class="fw-bold mb-3">3Ô∏è‚É£Look at their clients feedback/reviews</h5>
                            <p>A positive review shows you previous clients were really happy with the job done and are willing to share their positive experience.
                                </p>

                                <p>Now this one may be your personal preference. One way you can do this is by checking their social media accounts like their LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter e.t.c. 
                                    If you gain a lot from their posts then it's an indication that you'll get a lot of value from working with them.<br> I believe these 4 things will help you out when next you're looking for a graphic designer to hire.
                                    Please, also try to be a good client by being open with your designer and giving him/her all the informations they need to help you ü§ó
